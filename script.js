// We don't need to call the function in .addEventListener , javascript does it for us
// We have specified "click" in the addEventListener because we need the function to work when the user CLICKS the button(we have given the class of the check button in querySelector)
//.addEventListener is also an inbuilt function
//In the function first we have saved the value of the input field in the variable guess
//Then we have logged the result to the console with its data type(used typeOf for that)
//The data type of the value WAS coming to be string and we can't compare string with number so we converted the string into a number by using NUMBER FUNCTION
//Then we gave the condition for if the user does not select any value for the field
//How it works ðŸ‘‡
//If the user does not put any value in the input box then javascript will take it as a 0 and 0 is a FALSY value. Now we need the condition to be true so that our code works so we will use the NEGATION/NOT operator ( ! ) to reverse the value from false to true and the code will work.
//If the user puts any other value other than 0 then the code will not run as other number are TRUTHY value and the condition will become false becuase of negation operator. (P.S This is what we want)
